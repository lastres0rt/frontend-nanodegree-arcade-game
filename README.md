# Udacity Project 3 -- Classic Arcade Game Clone

![](http://i.imgur.com/zzSDZRE.png)

This project is meant to emulate the gameplay found in _Frogger_.

What this means:

1. The player moves across a grid.
2. There are bugs ("vehicles") moving horizontally across the screen which must be avoided.
3. The goal is to make it to the other side -- or in this case, from the bottom to the top of the screen.

# How to Play

1. Download everything, including the included image files.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Use the arrow keys to move your character around the screen.
4. Avoid bugs!
