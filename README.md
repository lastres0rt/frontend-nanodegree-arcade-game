![](https://imgur.com/zzSDZRE)

This project is meant to emulate the gameplay found in _Frogger_.

What this means:

1. The player moves across a grid.
2. There are bugs ("vehicles") moving horizontally across the screen which must be avoided.
3. The goal is to make it to the other side -- or in this case, from the bottom to the top of the screen.

# How to Play

1. Download the everything, including the included image files.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Play!
